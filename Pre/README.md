### Abstract

Today, artificial intelligence penetrates into all areas of human activity. Developed methods and recent advances in machine learning show good results and will gradually replace other \textit{"traditional"} approaches. AI allows to automate processes thereby improving efficiency and accuracy of tasks in co-operation with people. I worked on the problem of predicting ship motion from images of the sea surface.

First of all, using 3D graphics generator Blender, I created a dataset, which simulates the ship's movement through sea waves. This software also gives information about parameters of the boat (pitch and roll in our case). Data streams were structured in sequences and normalized for further processing. Then 9 different neural networks were developed and tested.
As I worked with time-ordered image sequences, I decided to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for processing images and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for time series processing.
Finally, I run the hyperband algorithm to find the best model hyperparameters and then all experiment results were analyzed. Also, some possible improvements are suggested.

### Blender simulation

As mentioned above the 3D graphics generator Blender was used to generate dataset. Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and 2D design.

Thanks to the work presented in [raport](https://github.com/manubatet/Ship-simulator/blob/master/ENSTA_ShipSimulator.pdf), we can use ready-made scripts to generate the necessary data. All needed is to specify the necessary parameters of the ocean, a camera position and an image expansion. (See how to install blender in [repository](https://github.com/Nazotron1923/ship-ocean_simulation_BLENDER))

### Datasets

In general, we generated 540 episodes (400 images per episode) = 216,000 images = 1800 minutes = 30 hours of simulations.

Also, to save memory, we chose rendering 2 frames per second. This is the best option so that the differences between two frames are noticeable and they do not "duplicate" the information.

### Data preprocessing

Before using the generated data, it needs to be processed. Since we used an artificial generator, all images have the same size and scaling or cropping is not required. However, data needs to be normalized, and so, every pixel value is converted into values between -1 and 1 (see Formula 1).
Since we are going to use pitch and roll values for some models, we normalize it with absolute values. The absolute values of these angles (pitch and roll) are -90 and 90 degrees, and so the Formula 2 is used to normalize the data in [-1, 1]:

### Models

To solve our pitch and roll prediction problem, existing model architectures will be used, whose advantages will be combined to achieve the best result. To begin, we consider the basic architectures for images - Convolutional Neural Networks and time series (in our case the simulation of the sea surface) - Long Short-Term Memory networks.

### Conclusion

In this work, in order to predict ship motion from images, nine deep neural network models were created and tested. Such variety of models is caused by the complexity of the problem. Empirical results show that models with LSTM parts and using additional information such as the current ship motion improve the pitch and roll prediction accuracy. The best result was achieved by a [CNN LSTM encoder-decoder images PR] model. The best combination of parameters was found using Hyperband algorithm (learning rate, weight decay, encoder latent vector size and decoder latent vector size). In general, the model normally exhibits fluctuations, and sometimes skips large peaks (not being accurately enough for the angle value). The problem is still not completely solved and can have many improvements. Even in the best version of the created model there are problems such as overfitting, poor generalization, etc.
Still, not solved the problem with the data, to achieve a better result and good working model real data from the ship is needed.
However, reasonable predictions are achieved with the proposed model.

python3 -m Pre.train -tf Pre/3dmodel/test_4_episode_
```

4. for prediction, goto Pre's parent folder and run command:
```
python3 -m Pre.test -f Pre/3dmodel/test_4_episode_

# Some issues

1. Be careful when setting parameters, check constants: for example, the sequence time [LEN_SEQ] should be large enough to include past window size + future window size.
